In the theoretical worst-case running time of the algorithm, it will
1. traverse a text file of n number of words
2. for each word of length m, it will sort the characters alphabetically
3. each sorted word is inserted into a hashmap with its corresponding word

traversing list of words in words.txt is O(n)
sorting a word of lengh m is O(mlog(m))
inserting a sorted word into a hashmap is O(1)

sorting a word of lengh m is and inserting it into a hashmap is O(mlog(m) + 1) âˆˆ O(mlog(m))
doing the step above for n words gives T(n) = O(n * mlog(m))
