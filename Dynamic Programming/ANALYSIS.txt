Description of the (recursive) formula - 
The recursive formula is based on considering all possible intermediate posts between two given posts i and j.

optimalCost[i][j] = minimum( optimalCost[i][j], optimalCost[i][k] + costMatrix[k][j] )
where i < k < j

Base Case:
If j = i + 1, then there is a direct connection between i and j:
optimalCost[i][j] = costMatrix[i][j]


In the theoretical worst-case running time of the algorithm - 
It will iterate over all possible pairs of posts and calculates the optimal costs using 3 nested loops.
Outer Loop on Length: Number of iterations: n - 2
Middle Loop on Starting Post i: Number of iterations for i: n - length
Inner Loop on Intermediate Post k: Number of iterations: length - 1
O(n^3)
